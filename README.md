# ADXL345-Arduino-I2C-Reader
This repository contains an Arduino-based project for reading acceleration data from the ADXL345 sensor using I2C communication. The code initializes the sensor, retrieves raw X, Y, and Z axis values, scales them for a Â±2g range, and prints the output to the Serial Monitor.
